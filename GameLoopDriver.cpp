/**
You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that 
(1) a player receives the correct number of armies in the reinforcement phase (showing different cases); 
(2) a player will only issue deploy orders and no other kind of orders if they still have armies in their reinforcement pool; 
(3) the game engine will only execute non-deploy orders when all the deploy orders of all players have been executed; 
(4) a player can issue advance orders to either defend or attack, based on the toAttack() and toDefend() lists; 
(5) a player can play cards to issue orders; 
(6) a player that does not control any territory is removed from the game; 
(7) the game ends when a single player controls all the territories. 
All of this except the issueOrder() method must be implemented in a single .cpp/.h file duo named GameEngine.cpp/GameEngine.h.
